# explore_api_demo
It's a demo in which i explore the contents of an API and restructure it using the holy trinity of javascript Array.prototype functions: map, filter and reduce.

## How to use
Register for an API key at last.fm using: [https://www.last.fm/api/account/create](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create).  
Add your API key to `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`.  
Use `npm start` to run the example

NB: this example uses nodemon, make sure to have it installed for everyone: `npm install -g nodemon`
